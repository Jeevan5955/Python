FUNCTION EXERCISES :

1. Given a list of ints, return True if the array contains a 3 next to a 3 somewhere.
2. Given a sentence, return a sentence with the words reversed.
3. Given an integer n, return True if n is within 10 of either 100 or 200.
4. Given three integers between 1 and 11, if their sum is less than or equal to 21, return their sum. If their sum exceeds 21 and there's an eleven, reduce the total sum by 10. Finally, if the sum (even after adjustment) exceeds 21, return 'BUST'.
5. Given two integers, return True if the sum of the integers is 20 or if one of the integers is 20. If not, return False.
6. Return list that contains only even no.
7. Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the next 9 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 9). Return 0 for no numbers.
8. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
9. Write a Python function that checks whether a word or phrase is palindrome or not.
10. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.
11. Write a Python function to check whether a string is pangram or not. (Assume the string passed in does not have any punctuation).
12. Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.
13. Write a function takes a two-word string and returns True if both words begin with same letter.
14. Write a function that capitalizes the first and fourth letters of a name.
15. Write a function that checks whether a number is in a given range (inclusive of high and low).
16. Write a function that computes the volume of a sphere given its radius.
17. Write a function that returns the lesser of two given numbers if both numbers are even, but returns the greater if one or both numbers are odd.
18. Write a function that returns the number of prime numbers that exist up to and including a given number.
19. Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns True if it contains 007 in order.
20. Write a function that takes in a single letter, and returns a 5x5 representation of that letter.
21. Checking for a even no in a list.py
22. FizzBuzz.py
23. Three cup monte.py

2. Line class methods to accept coordinates as a pair of tuples and return the slope and distance of the line.
3. Volume and Area of a cylinder.
4. Area and circumference of a circle.
